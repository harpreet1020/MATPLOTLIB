Given a complete dataset of rides from a ridesharing company, I showcased relationships between the following variables:

* Average Fare ($) Per City
* Total Number of Rides Per City
* Total Number of Drivers Per City
* City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

I also created the following pie charts:

* % of Total Fares by City Type
* % of Total Rides by City Type
* % of Total Drivers by City Type
